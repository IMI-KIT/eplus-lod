# EnergyPlus LOD

Exposes EnergyPlus simulation output files as linked open data.

## Concept

Conceptually, the library draws upon the SSN Ontology. The best way to get
started is to familiarize yourself with the ontology by reading the
[original paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2012.05.003).

The central idea of the SSN ontology is manifested in the Observation Pattern.
It names four distinct entities: the _feature of interest_, or the subject of
observation, the _property_, or the aspect of the feature that is being
observed, the _sensor_ that has performed the measurement, and the _observation
result_.

This library assumes that the four entities are indicated in the data
dictionary section of the simulation output file. For example, given the line
{{{
21,11,Electricity:Building [J] !RunPeriod [Value,Min,Month,Day,Hour,Minute,Max,Month,Day,Hour,Minute]
}}}

we can assign:

 * `Electricity` to the property,
 * `Building` to the feature of interest,
 * `21` to the sensor (technically, it is the simulation variable's report code),
 * The combination of the above to the observation result.

Additionally, the line indicates the unit of measurement, denoted in this case
by J, which is the symbol for the joule.

If the library can distinguish those five entities in the data dictionary, it
will produce an Observation and a corresponding Observation Result from the
combination. The disambiguation is guided by four
[mapping files](https://github.com/attadanta/rdf-mapper) that serve
as a configuration. They are described below.

### Resources

This `Resources.xml` file describes the mapping of the entities. The entity
names should correspond to the strings found in the data dictionary. Example:

{{{xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<mapping xmlns="http://imi.kit.edu/rdfMapping">
    <namespaces>
        <!-- snip -->
    </namespaces>

    <entities>
        <entity>
            <uri>:${simulationId}/Facility</uri>
            <name>Facility</name>
            <type>eplus:SimulationResource</type>
            <type>ssn:FeatureOfInterest</type>
        </entity>
    </entities>
</mapping>
}}}

This will match `Facility` in the data dictionary and, if the other components
are also present, construct an Observation linking to the Feature of Interest
with the indicated `uri` URL pattern.

Note, that you can completely customize the URL mapping and the types
assignment. Should you decide not to align with the SSN ontology, you are free to omit
the Feature Of Interest type assignment. You could also assign object and data
properties to the Facility entity. Keep in mind, however, that the entity will
be mapped against the data dictionary item, which may not provide enough context
to define the links and property values completely.

The `simulationId` fragment serves to distinguish the originating simulation
run and is optional. This named variable is injected externally as we will see below.

### Properties

Observation properties are configured in the `Properties.xml` files. An example
is given below.

{{{xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<mapping xmlns="http://imi.kit.edu/rdfMapping">
    <namespaces>
        <!-- snip -->
    </namespaces>

    <entities>
        <entity>
            <uri>:${simulationId}/${resource}/electricity</uri>
            <name>Electricity</name>
            <type>ssn:Property</type>
        </entity>
        <entity>
            <uri>:${simulationId}/${resource}/co2</uri>
            <name>CO2</name>
            <type>ssn:Property</type>
        </entity>
    </entities>
</mapping>
}}}

Again, the `name` tag is matched against the data dictionary item and hence
must be identical with the data dictionary contents.

To build a URL for the properties, we can use the `resource` named variable
to indicate a logical link with the resource entity. To make the relationship
explicit, you could also add a [ssn:isPropertyOf](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/ssnx/ssn#isPropertyOf)
object property assignment pointing to the `resourceURL`.

### Units

`Units.xml` configure units mappings. The example below demonstrates aligning
against the [OM](http://www.wurvoc.org/vocabularies/om-1.8/) ontology.

{{{xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<mapping xmlns="http://imi.kit.edu/rdfMapping">
    <namespaces>
        <!-- snip -->
    </namespaces>
    <entities>
        <entity>
            <uri>om:kilogram</uri>
            <name>kg</name>
        </entity>
        <entity>
            <uri>om:joule</uri>
            <name>J</name>
        </entity>
        <entity>
            <uri>om:cubic_metre</uri>
            <name>m3</name>
        </entity>
    </entities>
</mapping>
}}}

Here, we map directly to the concepts of the OM ontology.

### Observation

Lastly, we interlink the concepts described thus far by implementing the
Observation Pattern. The configuration is given by the `Observation.xml`,
which should define the following entity mappings.

#### Sensor

The `Sensor` mapping distinguishes the Sensor entity of the pattern. Below, we
assume that this is represented by the report code of the simulation output
variable:

{{{xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<mapping xmlns="http://imi.kit.edu/rdfMapping">
    <!-- snip -->
    <entity>
        <uri>:${simulationId}/sensors/${variableId}</uri>
        <name>Sensor</name>
    </entity>
    <!-- snip -->
</mapping>
}}}

#### Observation Result

The `ObservationResult` entity collects all references to the obtained
simulation values. Below, we use a combination of the `variableId` and
`property` variables to construct its URL.

{{{xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<mapping xmlns="http://imi.kit.edu/rdfMapping">
    <!-- snip -->
    <entity>
        <uri>:${simulationId}/observation/${variableId}/${property}/result</uri>
        <name>ObservationResult</name>
        <type>eplus:OutputDataset</type>
        <type>ssn:ObservationResult</type>
    </entity>
    <!-- snip -->
</mapping>
}}}

#### Observation

The `Observation` entity configures the central entity in the Observation
pattern. By now, it should be obvious how to construct it keeping in mind
that the mapper keeps record of the URLs of the entities defined above.

{{{xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<mapping xmlns="http://imi.kit.edu/rdfMapping">
    <!-- snip -->
    <entity>
        <uri>:${simulationId}/observations/${variableId}/${property}</uri>
        <name>Observation</name>
        <type>ssn:Observation</type>
        <properties>
            <objectProperty>
                <uri>ssn:featureOfInterest</uri>
                <object>${resourceURL}</object>
            </objectProperty>
            <objectProperty>
                <uri>ssn:observedProperty</uri>
                <object>${propertyURL}</object>
            </objectProperty>
            <objectProperty>
                <uri>ssn:observationResult</uri>
                <object>${observationResultURL}</object>
            </objectProperty>
            <objectProperty>
                <uri>ssn:observedBy</uri>
                <object>${sensorURL}</object>
            </objectProperty>
        </properties>
    </entity>
    <!-- snip -->
</mapping>
}}}

#### Observation Value

Finally, we specify how to map observation values. Conveniently, every named
variable that was mapped during the construction of the Observation entity is
available by the time the values are exported. Additionally, the report
line can also be accessed by its numbered components: `#{0}` maps to the
report code and `#{1}` to the numerical value.

In the example below, we demonstrate how the detected unit of measurement is
integrated within the frame of the OM ontology.

{{{xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<mapping xmlns="http://imi.kit.edu/rdfMapping">
    <!-- snip -->
    <entity>
        <uri></uri>
        <name>ObservationValue</name>
        <type>qb:Observation</type>
        <type>ssn:ObservationValue</type>
        <type>eplus:SimulationValue</type>
        <type>om:Measure</type>
        <properties>
            <objectProperty>
                <uri>qb:dataSet</uri>
                <object>${observationResultURL}</object>
            </objectProperty>
            <dataProperty>
                <uri>om:numerical_value</uri>
                <value>#{1}</value>
            </dataProperty>
            <objectProperty>
                <uri>om:unit_of_measure_or_measurement_scale</uri>
                <object>${unitURL}</object>
            </objectProperty>
        </properties>
    </entity>
    <!-- snip -->
</mapping>
}}}
